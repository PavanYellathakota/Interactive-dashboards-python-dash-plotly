## Project Overview
The **Startup Performance Dashboard** is a Python application built with Dash, Plotly, and Bootstrap. It visualizes startup metrics such as revenue, profit, employees, and market share, allowing users to filter data by sector, region, and funding stage. The dashboard is interactive in a web browser and generates a static HTML file (`Interactive_dashboard.html`) for offline viewing.

## Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Dropdown menus to filter by sector, region, and funding stage.
- **Four Charts**:
  - Pie Chart: Revenue by sector.
  - Bar Chart: Average employees by funding stage.
  - Scatter Chart: Revenue vs. profit.
  - Bubble Chart: Market share vs. customer count.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Bootstrap for a clean, mobile-friendly layout.
- **Static HTML Export**: Saves a snapshot of the dashboard with Plotlyâ€™s interactivity (hover, zoom, pan).
- **Error Handling**: Displays "No Data Available" when filters yield no results.
